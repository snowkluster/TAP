Dear Cracked Community,

As you all know, the 29.01.2025 has been a very dark day in our history. It took us some weeks to reflect on what had happened, how to move forward and especially when to move forward. We had to rework our shoutbox during that time and imported a backup from the 25th January 2025.
Everyone that made a purchase after the 25h January can message @Liars with a proof of payment and we will add back the purchased upgrade or credits.


To give you some Information regarding the seizure - our Server was encrypted and law enforcement is not able to review your posts, passwords or anything alike.
We have taken measures to prevent further seizures, but there isn't a 100% guarantee - especially not in the clearweb. If you are unsure, you are still free to change your passwords or delete your private messages.
As a concesquence of Operation Talent, that was targeted to completely shut down Cracked forever, @Liars will be the new Administrator of Cracked.sh.

Everyone that wants to purchase an upgrade or credits will need to do this manually with @Liars.
We are working in the meantime on a new payment system and believe that should be live within 1 week. Until then just send @Liars a PM.
Every possible forum bug you may encounter will be fixed during the next days and weeks.

We hope everyone stays safe and want to thank everyone that was waiting patiently for the return of Cracked.

Best regards,
Cracked.sh Administration
